# DevSec Training

**Location** - [Online with PDF](https://cssa-training.slack.com/)

**Brief** - James presenting DevOps training to us via Zoom.  Handouts and recordings are saved in our slack workspace.

**Lessons Learned**:

- The Tree Ways:

  - The First Way: Flow.  This is the movement of the project from left to right.  It is our normal work cycle from requirements to delivery.
  - The Second Way: Feedback:  This is the getting results back from our flow.  Ideally we are looking to shorten the feedback loop.  For example, we can set up a CI environment to get feedback when builds fail after someone commits the code.  The sooner this happens, the easier, cheaper and faster the fix.
  - The Third Way: Experimentation and Improvements: People learn through Experimentation.  Management needs to allow us to try things out that we think might be beneficial to our project/office.  If we can show that it does help we keep the change and through this iterative cycle, we will be much better off tomorrow than today.  Similarly if our experiment doesn't work, it isn't a failure.  We learned what didn't work and have a better idea of what we can try in the future.

- DevOps provides a set of ideas/recommendations to strive for.  It does not specify how each and every project gets there.  It is up to us to figure out how we can best implement.
- Communication:  Communication is key.  A major point of DevOps is to be as transparent as possible.  Provide small incremental updates that allows the customers the ability to provide feedback/course correction of the product.  They will be much happier and get a product they truly want.
